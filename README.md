# Statistical Modelling and Pattern Recognition University Project

This repository contains the exercises and projects completed as part of the **"Statistical Modelling and Pattern Recognition"** course at Technical University of Crete. The course material is divided into two exercise sets, focusing on foundational techniques in statistical modeling, classification, and pattern recognition.

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This repository is structured into **two exercise sets**, covering key methodologies in statistical analysis and machine learning. Below is a summary of the topics explored in each set:

### **Exercise Set 1: Statistical Classification and Dimensionality Reduction**
1. **Bayes Classification & Minimum Risk**  
   - Implementation of Bayesian classifiers and decision rules incorporating risk minimization.
2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
   - Matrix factorization for dimensionality reduction and noise reduction in datasets.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
   - Feature extraction and visualization using PCA for high-dimensional data.
4. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**  
   - Supervised dimensionality reduction for maximizing class separability.

### **Exercise Set 2: Regression, Estimation, and Neural Models**
1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Binary and multinomial classification using logistic regression models.
2. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**  
   - Parameter estimation techniques for statistical models.
3. **Neural Networks**  
   - Implementation of feedforward networks for pattern recognition tasks.
